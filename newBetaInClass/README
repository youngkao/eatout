This is a simple binary decision making program. You start off on the main menu and click space to continue. Currently we only have one path of decisions pathed out
Space bar can used at any time to progress to the next "level." This code as originally based around my Intro to Software Engineering game I made so there is still some code
from that that needs to be cleaned up.

How to use:
        The idea of our app is to have a saved set amount of lists that users premake so they can easily select them anytime they open the app.
        Currently there is no input method, so the only working list is favorites.
        Once you start making decisions you press 1 or 2 depending on which option you want to win (currently a set path, so no decision yet)

Future Plans: 
        Incorporate the logos in as objects so you can click on them to choose the winner
        Any inputs can be flagged as already having a logo, so if you type in mcdonalds we'll shove the logo into the list
        If an input like "Tony's Pizza" gets put in and there is no logo it will just use the text
